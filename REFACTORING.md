## 🚀 How to Use

### **Running the Project**

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps  # For React 19 compatibility
npm run dev
```

### **Adding New Products**

Edit `/lib/constants.ts` and add to the `PRODUCTS` array:

```typescript
{
  id: 6,
  title: 'New Product',
  price: 'Rs. 10,000',
  image: '/path-to-image.jpg',
  description: 'Product description',
  sizes: ['S', 'M', 'L'],
  images: ['image1.jpg', 'image2.jpg'],
  category: 'Category Name',
  inStock: true,
  featured: false
}
```

### **Creating New Product Categories**

Add to the `CATEGORIES` array in `/lib/constants.ts`:

```typescript
{
  id: 5,
  title: 'NEW CATEGORY',
  image: '/category-image.jpg',
  description: 'Category description',
  slug: 'new-category'
}
```

### **Using Components**

```tsx
import { ProductGrid } from "@/components/product-grid";
import { SectionContainer } from "@/components/section-container";

<SectionContainer padding="lg" background="gray">
  <ProductGrid
    products={products}
    viewMode="grid"
    onQuickView={handleQuickView}
    onAddToCart={handleAddToCart}
  />
</SectionContainer>;
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### **TypeScript Paths**

The project now supports clean imports:

```typescript
import { Product } from "@/types";
import { PRODUCTS } from "@/lib/constants";
import { ProductCard } from "@/components/product-card";
```

### **Theme Support**

The project includes a theme provider for future dark mode support:

```tsx
<ThemeProvider
  attribute="class"
  defaultTheme="light"
  enableSystem
  disableTransitionOnChange
>
  {children}
</ThemeProvider>
```

## 📋 Next Steps

### **Recommended Enhancements**

1. **Backend Integration**: Connect to a real API for products and user data
2. **Authentication**: Implement user login/signup functionality
3. **Shopping Cart**: Complete the cart functionality with persistence
4. **Payment Integration**: Add payment processing capabilities
5. **Admin Panel**: Create an admin interface for product management
6. **Search**: Implement full-text search functionality
7. **Reviews**: Add product reviews and ratings
8. **Internationalization**: Add multi-language support

### **Performance Optimizations**

1. Implement virtual scrolling for large product lists
2. Add image optimization and lazy loading
3. Implement proper caching strategies
4. Add service worker for offline capabilities

## 🎨 Design System

The refactored project follows a consistent design system:

- **Colors**: Neutral grays with accent colors
- **Typography**: Inter for body text, Playfair Display for headings
- **Spacing**: Consistent padding and margins using Tailwind
- **Components**: Reusable UI components with shadcn/ui
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and hover effects

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

For future development, consider adding:

- Unit tests for utility functions
- Component testing with React Testing Library
- End-to-end tests with Playwright or Cypress
- Visual regression testing

## 📝 Notes

- The project uses React 19 with legacy peer dependencies for compatibility
- All components are properly typed with TypeScript
- The architecture supports easy scaling and maintenance
- State management is prepared for future integration with Redux or Zustand if needed

This refactoring provides a solid foundation for a production-ready e-commerce application with modern React practices and excellent developer experience.
